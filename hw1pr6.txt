//Exercise #1 Sock Sorting (plain-English)

We will need:

    Laundry items - 
        Basket
    
    Clothing Items - 
        Socks

How to sort laundry itmes:
    
    Instructions - 
        Step 1: Grab basket full of socks
        Step 2: Dump socks on top of folding area
        Step 3: Seperate socks into piles by similar patterns or types
        Step 4: Look at piles individually and further pair into identical patterns or types
        Step 5: Fold matching pairs that were identified
        Step 6: Put folded socks away
        Step 7: Put basket away



//Exercise #1 Sock Sorting (pseudocode)

#include laundry
// pseudocode intent: to include a library in which common items related to laundry will be enabled
// for use in the program.

// declarations
basket myBasket
socks mySocks
sort sortSocks

//initializations
mySocks = ankle or calf
myBasket = mySocks

//function that sorts socks into pairs by type
sortSocks = laundry.sort(myBasket)

return 0;




//Exercise #2: From decimal to binary! (plain-English)

Get number:
    Request user to input a number

Convert decimal number into binary-

    Input number into binary converter function:
        Divide number by 2
        Store value as an integer
        If there is a remainder store as a 1
        If number divides evenly store as a 0
        If no longer able to divide by 2, output 1 and end function

Output binary:
    Put binary number to console


//Exercise #2: From decimal to binary! (pseudocode)

//libraries that will be useful such as input/output and common math operators
include iostream
include math 

//declarations
int x

//initializations
x = get next input
array = converter

//function
converter{
    if x > 0 then divide by 2
        else return 0;
    if there is a remainder store in array as 1
        else store as a 0;
    if reduced to 1 store as 1;
}

//use function to output binary
array = converter(x)

//output results
print array
